# File-Organizer
Usual statistics depict that the **Downloads** folder of a system is very chaotic and unorganized, I created a Python script which will do it for you!
+ A simple python script which will clean-up and organize any folder
+ If you have a folder with many files of various extensions, then don't worry, just run this Python script and it will create sub-folders based on the file type and move those files to the created folder.
+ This is heavily useful and saves a lot of time and power of manually organising and creating folders.
